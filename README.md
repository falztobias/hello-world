# hello-world

I am a PhD Biophysicist adding data science tools to my toolbelt.  I am looking forward to learning many new techniques to augment my years of experience developing analytical tools and new metrics for describing and understanding self assembling bio-material datasets with various aspects of machine learning and big data tools.  Wish me luck and speed!
